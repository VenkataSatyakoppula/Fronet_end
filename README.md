# AUTOMATED BOOK LOCATOR USING RASPBERRY PI - P PRANEETH REDDY, K VENKATA SATYA, B RADHA KRISHNA

Front End For Raspberry pi Project

In this project, a website that assists in finding the desired book will be developed. HTML, Bootstrap, PHP, jQuery, JavaScript, and Django will be used to build the website. To find a reference number, a database is searched for the book's title. The LED strips show the user the precise location of the book inside the shelf using a Raspberry Pi.

This project will assist users in searching the books quickly with mobile devices and smartphones and can look or the necessary books without even touching the racks, as the technologies used previously for finding or searching the books arise some problems in searching books.
